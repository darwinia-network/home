    "faq_2_content_2": "Pros: Users can participate in staking as soon as possible to get rewards.",
    "faq_2_content_3": "Cons: Users' coins will lose liquidity for a while. May be until mid-November.  TRON and Crab's cross-chain bridge has no plans yet, and it will take longer to lose liquidity.",
    "faq_3_title": "3. Is there a deadline for \"Genesis Generation\"?",
    "faq_3_content": "Yes. The deadline for \"Genesis Generation\" is 2020-09-24 8:00 UTC or 2020-09-24 16:00 Beijing.",

    "faq_5_content_2": "In the third stage of the launch (approximately 0.5 or 1 month after the second stage), the Ethereum-Darwinia bidirectional bridge will be opened, and RINGs/KTONs can be freely transferred between these two networks.",
    "faq_6_title": "6. When will the TRON-Darwinia cross-chain bridge open?",
    "faq_6_content": "Currently, the cross-chain transfer of RINGs and KTONs on the TRON to Darwinia mainnet can only be done during the \"Genesis Generation\". The TRON-Darwinia cross-chain bridge will be implemented in the fourth stage.",

    "faq_12_title": "12. Can I genesis cross-chain transfer KTONs only?",
    "faq_12_content": "No. Because when you are participating in staking on the mainnet, a small number of RINGs is required as a gas, so you must transfer some RINGs as gas to the mainnet. It is recommended to have at least 1 RING, which can be 100 CRING mapping to RING, or transfer 1 RING to the main network.",
